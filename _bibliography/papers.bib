abstract = {There is no controversy on the assertion that entanglement and nonlocality are distinct resources. It is acknowledged that a clear illustration of this fact is the discrepancy between maximally entangled states and states that maximally violate a Bell inequality (usually identified with maximally nonlocal states), for systems composed by two qutrits. We argue that this anomaly is an artefact of the measures that have been used to quantify Bell nonlocality. By reasoning that the numeric value of a Bell function is akin to a witness rather than a quantifier, we define a measure of nonlocality and show that, for two qutrits and two four-dimensional Hilbert spaces, maximal entanglement does correspond to maximal nonlocality. As a consequence of our proposal, the question wether violations in local causality grow with the dimension of Hilbert spaces is reopen.},

abstract = {Channels composed by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs are capable of teleporting arbitrary multipartite states. The question arises whether EPR channels are also optimal against imperfections. In particular, the teleportation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states (GHZ) requires three EPR states as the channel and full measurements in the Bell basis. We show that, by using two GHZ states as the channel, it is possible to transport any unknown three-qubit state of the form $c_0|000\rangle+c_1|111\rangle$. The teleportation is made through measurements in the GHZ basis, and, to obtain deterministic results, in most of the investigated scenarios, four out of the eight elements of the basis need to be unambiguously distinguished. Most importantly, we show that when both, systematic errors and noise are considered, the fidelity of the teleportation protocol is higher when a GHZ channel is used in comparison to that of a channel composed by EPR pairs.},

@article{Fonseca2018,
abstract = {The question of how Bell nonlocality behaves in bipartite systems of higher dimensions is ad-dressed. By employing the probability of violation of local realism under random measurements as the figure of merit, we investigate the nonlocality of entangled qudits with dimensions ranging from d = 2 to d = 7. We proceed in two complementary directions. First, we study the specific Bell scenario defined by the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality. Second, we consider the nonlocality of the same states under a more general perspective, by directly addressing the space of joint probabilities (computing the frequencies of behaviours outside the local polytope). In both approaches we find that the nonlocality decreases as the dimension d grows, but in quite distinct ways. While the drop in the probability of violation is exponential in the CGLMP scenario, it presents, at most, a linear decay in the space of behaviours. Furthermore, in both cases the states that produce maximal numeric violations in the CGLMP inequality present low probabilities of violation in comparison with maximally entangled states, so, no anomaly is observed. Finally, the nonlocality of states with non-maximal Schmidt rank is investigated.},

@article{Moreno2018,
abstract = {The problem of noise incidence on qubits taking part of bipartite entanglement-based protocols is addressed. It is shown that the use of a three-partite GHZ state and measurements instead of their EPR counterparts allows the experimenter to detect 2/3 of the times whenever one of the qubits involved in the measurement is affected by bit-flip noise through the mere observation of unexpected outcomes in the teleportation and superdense coding protocols when compared to the ideal case. It is shown that the use of post-selection after the detection of noise leads to an enhancement in the efficiency of the protocols. The idea is extended to any protocol using entangled states and measurements. Furthermore, a generalization is provided in which GHZ states and measurements with an arbitrary amount of qubits are used instead of EPR pairs, and remarkably, it is concluded that the optimal number of qubits is only three.},

In particular, we consider the case representing the next level of complexity beyond the simplest (though far from trivial) one, namely the bipartite case. This kind of entanglement plays an essential role in understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics. It also allows for implementing several applications in the fields of quantum information processing and quantum computing. In this paper, we review the fundamental aspects of tripartite entanglement focusing on Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger and W states for discrete variables. We discuss the possibility of using it as a resource to execute quantum protocols and present some examples in detail.},

abstract = {We study the protocol of qudit teleportation using quantum systems subjected to several kinds of noise for arbitrary dimensionality d. We consider four classes of noise: Dit-flip, d-phase-flip, dit-phase-flip, and depolarizing noise, each of them corresponding to a family of Weyl operators, introduced via Kraus formalism. We derive a general expression for the average fidelity of teleportation in arbitrary dimension d for any combination of noise on the involved qudits. Under a different approach we derive the average fidelity of teleportation for a more general scenario involving the d-dimensional generalization of amplitude damping noise as well. We show that all possible scenarios may be classified in four different behaviors and discuss the cases in which it is possible to improve the fidelity by increasing the associated noise fractions. All our results are in agreement with previous analysis for the case of qubits [R. Fortes and G. Rigolin, Phys. Rev. A 92, 012338 (2015)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.92.012338].},

abstract = {Decoherence of quantum systems is described by quantum channels. However, a complete understanding of such channels, especially in the multiparticle setting, is still an ongoing difficult task. We propose the family of quantum maps that preserve or completely erase the components of a multiqubit system in the basis of Pauli strings, which we call Pauli component erasing maps. For the corresponding channels, it is shown that the preserved components can be interpreted as a finite vector subspace, from which we derive several properties and complete the characterization. Moreover, we show that the obtained family of channels forms a semigroup and derive its generators. We use this simple structure to determine physical implementations and connect the obtained family of channels with Markovian processes.},

abstract = {Quantum channels, a subset of quantum maps, describe the unitary and non-unitary evolution of quantum systems. We study a generalization of the concept of Pauli maps to the case of multipartite high dimensional quantum systems through the use of the Weyl operators. The condition for such maps to be valid quantum channels, i.e. complete positivity, is derived in terms of Fourier transform matrices. From these conditions, we find the extreme points of this set of channels and identify an elegant algebraic structure nested within them. In turn, this allows us to expand upon the concept of "component erasing channels" introduced in earlier work by the authors. We show that these channels are completely characterized by elements drawn of finite cyclic groups. An algorithmic construction for such channels is presented and the smallest subsets of erasing channels which generate the whole set are determined.},
